# Online Voting System Smart Contracts

Welcome to the **Online Voting System Contracts** package! This project contains the core Ethereum smart contracts and related tooling that enable secure, transparent, and auditable online elections.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

- **Implement robust and secure smart contracts** for election management, ballot casting, and result verification on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Enable interoperability** with backend and frontend services for seamless voting experiences.
- **Facilitate automated deployments, testing, and upgrades** of election contracts.

---

## 🏗️ Project Structure

- `contracts/` – Solidity smart contracts (e.g., `Voting.sol`)
- `scripts/` – Hardhat scripts for deployment and management (e.g., `deploy.ts`)
- `test/` – TypeScript/JavaScript tests for smart contracts (e.g., `VotingGuardian.test.ts`)
- `typechain-types/` – TypeChain-generated TypeScript typings for contracts (auto-generated)
- `artifacts/`, `cache/` – Hardhat build artifacts and cache (auto-generated)
- `.env.example` – Example environment variables (network, keys)
- `hardhat.config.ts` – Hardhat configuration (networks, plugins, compiler, etc.)
- `tsconfig.json` – TypeScript configuration
- `package.json` – Project dependencies and scripts

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Solidity** for smart contract development
- **[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)** for Ethereum development environment and tooling
- **TypeScript** for scripts and tests
- **TypeChain** for TypeScript contract bindings
- **Ethers.js** for Ethereum interactions in scripts/tests
- **pnpm** for package management

## 🧑‍💻 Onboarding & Development

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in required values (RPC URLs, private keys, etc.)

### 3. Compile Contracts

```bash
pnpm hardhat compile
```

### 4. Run Tests

```bash
pnpm hardhat test
```

### 5. Deploy Contracts

```bash
pnpm hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network <network>
```
